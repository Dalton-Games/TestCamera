TestCamera
==========

Pseudo Isometric 3d Camera test

Initial test implementation.

What does actually :

* WASD moves the camera
* Q and E rotates camera around the Z axis (vertical axis)
* Ctrl + W and Ctrl + S control the zoom level. Ctrl+W does zoom in
* Moving the mouse to the viewport edges, moves the camera
* Mouse wheel does camera zoom
* Draging with the right button of the mouse, moves the view
* Left virtual joystick for mobiles, moves the camera.
* Camera only collides with invisble walls that limits the play field
