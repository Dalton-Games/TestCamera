TestCamera
==========

Pseudo Isometric 3d Camera test

Initial test implementation.

What does actually :

* WASD moves the camera
* Q and E rotates camera around the Z axis (vertical axis)
* Ctrl + W and Ctrl + S control the zoom level. Ctrl+W does zoom in
* Mouse wheel does camera zoom
* Draging with the right button of the mouse, moves the view
* Left virtual joystick for mobiles, moves the camera.
* Camera only collides with invisble walls that limits the play field
* Depth of Field Blur that comes from nearly nothing when the camera is far, to intese effect when the user zooms in
